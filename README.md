## ü§ì Summary 
Creating the "MILOLOVE" homepage using Bootstrap 4 was a great way to deepen my understanding of both the framework and responsive design. Throughout the project, I learned how to effectively use Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system, components, and utilities to quickly build a professional-looking, responsive website. I also gained valuable experience in customizing Bootstrap with SCSS to better fit the specific needs of the project, which really helped improve my front-end development skills.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to navigate and make the most out of Bootstrap's documentation, especially since it was my first time doing so. This experience made me realize how important it is to fully understand the tools and resources a framework offers. Being able to modify and extend these tools is crucial for creating unique and functional web designs.

This project also highlighted the importance of grasping the core principles behind frameworks like Bootstrap. While these tools are great for speeding up development, knowing how to dig into their documentation, tweak, and extend them is key to building custom, high-quality websites.
