# "MILOLOVE": Bootstrap home page for shop
"MILOLOVE" is a simple homepage view created using the Bootstrap library. The entire project is based on Flexbox and Media Queries, with a strong emphasis on RWD (Responsive Web Design) principles, to ensure the site is maximally flexible and adapted to the needs of users.

## ü§ì Summary 
Designing a website with Bootstrap taught me that you can quickly and easily create a page without the need to write a large amount of code from scratch. I learned how to read the framework's documentation.
